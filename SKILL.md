description: >
  Creates and edits Marp presentations with a beamer-style theme (dark-blue
  header bar, three-section footer, definition blocks, styled tables). Use this
  skill whenever the user is working on a Marp slide deck — whether writing
  slides from scratch, fixing CSS bugs (shadow columns, gap lines), setting up
  VS Code for Marp, customising colours or layout, or asking about any Marp /
  Marpit directive or image syntax. Trigger even if the user just says "make me
  some slides" or "I need a presentation" and they're in a Marp project.

# Marp Beamer Skill

## How to use this skill

Read only the reference file(s) relevant to the current task. Do not load all files.

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Writing slide content, using directives, images, math | `references/marpit-syntax.md` |
| Building or debugging the beamer CSS theme | `references/beamer-css.md` |
| Generating a new deck or slide from a template | `references/slide-templates.md` |
| Setting up VS Code + registering the theme | `references/marpit-syntax.md` (§ VS Code setup) |
| Copying the ready-to-use CSS file | `assets/beamer.css` |
| Appendix TOC with clickable links + back buttons | `references/slide-templates.md` (§ Appendix navigation) |
| Speaker notes + presenter mode | `references/marpit-syntax.md` (§ Speaker notes) |

## Customisation hierarchy — internalize this first

Every visual tweak in a Marp beamer deck operates at one of three levels.
Always pick the narrowest scope that satisfies the need.

```
Level 1 — Deck-wide (all slides)
  → Override :root tokens in the frontmatter style: block
  → Affects every slide simultaneously
  → Examples: --font-size, --pad-x, --primary, --table-max-width

Level 2 — Per-slide (one slide only)
  → Define section.classname { ... } in frontmatter style:
  → Apply with <!-- _class: classname --> on that slide
  → Multiple classes are space-separated
  → Examples: section.small-text, section.wide-table, section.center-table

Level 3 — Inline (specific element, word, or line)
  → Use <span style="..."> for words/phrases
  → Use <div class="center">, <div class="caption"> for block-level
  → Requires "markdown.marp.html": true in .vscode/settings.json
```

**Critical constraint:** `:root` variable overrides do NOT work inside `_class`
rules — Marp does not re-evaluate CSS custom properties at section scope.
Target elements directly instead:

```yaml
# WRONG — has no effect:
section.my-slide { --font-size: 18px; }

# CORRECT — targets element directly:
section.my-slide { font-size: 18px; }
section.my-slide table { font-size: 0.7em; }
```

## Critical rules — internalize before writing anything

These are the two bugs that reliably appear when building beamer-style themes for
Marp. They look subtle on screen but have simple root causes.

### 1 — Table shadow column

**Symptom:** A phantom column (same background as table, no text) appears to the
right of the last real column, with a dark border on the far right.

**Cause:** Putting `background-color` on the `<table>` element itself. When the
table element is wider than its cell columns, the table's own background bleeds
into the empty space.

**Fix — three properties, always together:**
```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse; /* cells share borders, no gaps */
  background: none;          /* no background on table element — only on th/td */
  width: fit-content;        /* table is exactly as wide as its columns */
}
```

Never put `background-color` directly on `table`. Put it only on `th`, `td`, and `tr`.

### 2 — Definition-block gap line

**Symptom:** A thin visible seam between the coloured title bar (h4) and the body
of a `blockquote:has(> h4)` definition block.

**Cause:** Applying `border-radius` to all four corners of both the `h4` and `p`
children. Where their adjacent edges meet, the inward-curving corners reveal the
parent's background, creating the seam.

**Fix — `overflow: hidden` on the parent, `border-radius: 0` on children:**
```css
blockquote:has(> h4) {
  border-radius: var(--radius);
  overflow: hidden;   /* clips children flush — no seam possible */
}
blockquote:has(> h4) h4 { border-radius: 0; }
blockquote:has(> h4) p  { border-radius: 0; }
```

### 3 — Large gap between bold label paragraphs and bullet lists

**Symptom:** Slides that mix a bold label paragraph (`**Label**`) immediately above a
bullet list show a conspicuously large blank between the two — roughly 0.75 em even
though no extra blank line exists in the Markdown source.

**Cause:** CSS specificity. The beamer theme resets all margins with `* { margin: 0; padding: 0 }`,
but the universal selector `*` has specificity 0-0-0. Marp's built-in base stylesheet
contains `p { margin: 0.5em 0; }` at specificity 0-0-1 — it wins every time, so `<p>`
elements retain a 0.5 em top/bottom margin regardless of the reset.
The visible gap is `p margin-bottom (0.5 em) + ul margin-top (0.25 em) = 0.75 em`.

**Fix — add an explicit `p` rule after the heading block:**
```css
p { margin: 0.15em 0; }
```

This overrides Marp's built-in at equal or greater specificity (loaded later in the
cascade). The resulting gap shrinks to ~0.4 em, which reads naturally without being
so tight it collapses distinct sections.

## Quick-start checklist for a new deck

1. Copy `assets/beamer.css` → `.vscode/beamer.css` in the project
2. Create `.vscode/settings.json`:
   ```json
   { "markdown.marp.themes": [".vscode/beamer.css"], "markdown.marp.html": true }
   ```
3. Reload VS Code window (`Cmd+Shift+P → Reload Window`)
4. Add frontmatter: `marp: true`, `theme: beamer`, `paginate: true`, `footer: '**Author** **Title** **Venue**'`
5. First slide: `<!-- _class: title -->`
6. Each section: `<!-- header: 'Section Name' -->` (local — persists forward)
7. Blank header on one slide: `<!-- _header: '' -->` (spot — this slide only)
